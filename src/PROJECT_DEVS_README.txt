IMPORT STATEMENTS:
To avoid import errors make sure you are working from the project source directory.
That means inside the src folder. All imports should be relative to the src folder and not from which folder
you are in right now.

TEST FILES:
All test files must have the same naming convention in order for unittest to recognize them.
The current pattern is test_somename.py.
