Notes: Egill
Present: Egill, Gunnhildur, Haraldur, Jóhann

TA will mostly look at the master branch for commits. So it is important to push your branches frequently.
The TA strongly advides us to use vanilla python for various of reasons and also informed us that we were the only group using django.
We have decided to only use python and follow the three layerd architecture wheres we have the Data layer, logic layer and presentation layer
which will be provided by the TA's.
He also informed us that we will only be reciving strings encoded in JSON.
There will be some changes to the usecases because the reasons above.
In this sprint we will mostly be be focusing on getters and setters (create and read)
NOTE FROM TA:"Keep it simple"

Notes: Egill

Since project layout will be structured as three layered architecture so it was decided to
implement method for each model in an indivitual class to prevent conflicts and keep the code diveded.
All model now have a jsonify method to return json encoded objects
All team members must write tests for their code and get at least 50% test coverage
