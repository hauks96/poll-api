**Video demo script**
1. Show all the functionality that is supported in the official frontend. Just run the communicator and the frontend.
Run a little through the debug page and visual page (create something if possible ) <- Not possible we can show this in our own implementation.
2. Show from our gitlab repository's readme table what methods are actually integrated and supported. (Just showing the table while talking)
3. Show our own WebSocket interface to show additional methods. Mostly the methods requiring authentication. Create something
and delete it for example. Get an intentional error message while doing something.
4. Go over the test_poll (they look the most efficient) and talk about our testing process.
 for example how we create test data to test our methods and how we test the method
5. Run the test and show to report in either terminal or HTML
