Sprint retrospective:

- We could have met up earlier in order to properly sync in person, but have been working
    diligently none the less. Have had slight troubles finding times to meet. 
- We started working slightly ahead of ourselves in the Domain Model and had to backtrack 
    slightly.

- Decisions we made included:

    - Went over all user stories together in order to improve quality.
    - Found better ways to work together and got into a more advanced quality
    of communication.
